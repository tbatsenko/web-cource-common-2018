        <h3>1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and its associated DOM APIs and is intended for web site and application developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their students. That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do so.</p>
        <p>This guide is structured into three major sections. The first provides a set of basic templates for authors to get started with.</p>
        <p>The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML and XHTML documents. This will investigate both the similarities and differences between the two alternatives and provides guidance on choosing which to use for your own projects, depending on your needs. Additionally, this will also provide details about creating polyglot documents — that is, documents that conform to both HTML and XHTML simultaneiously — including issues related to ensuring stylesheets and scripts work correctly under both conditions.</p>
        <p>The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML vocabulary. Each element is described, providing details about its its meaning, allowed attributes, content models and DOM APIs. Each is accompanied by clear examples illustrating how the element is designed to be used for a range of different use cases.</p>

        <h3>2 Basic Templates</h3>
        <p>The following basic templates are designed to be used as starting points for the documents you create. Several alternatives are provided, allowing individuals to choose the template that is most appropriate for their needs.</p>
        <figure>
            <h4>Simple: HTML:</h4>
            <p><em>The most basic template recommended for most authors.</em></p>
            <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
        &lt;title>HTML Template&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;p>Insert content here.&lt;/p>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
                </pre>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h4>Intermediate: HTML and XHTML Polyglot:</h4>
            <p><em>Template suitable for intermediate authors who are producing documents adhering to the polyglot markup conventions. While this template is safe for beginners to use, it is only recommended for authors familiar with the techniques for creating polyglot documents.</em></p>
            <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
    &lt;head>
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
        &lt;title>Polyglot (X)HTML Template&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;p>Insert content here.&lt;/p>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
                </pre>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h4>Advanced: XHTML:</h4>
            <p><em>Template suitable for advanced authors who are producing XHTML documents. This template is not suitable for use as HTML because it lacks the DOCTYPE and does not declare the character encoding. Authors using this template should be using UTF-8 or UTF-16, or should at least be aware of how to declare the correct encoding for XML.</em></p>
            <pre>
&lt;html>
    &lt;head>
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
        &lt;title>XHTML Template&lt;/title>
    &lt;/head>
    &lt;body>
        &lt;p>Insert content here.&lt;/p>
    &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
                </pre>
        </figure>

        <figure>
            <h4>Advanced: Minimal HTML:</h4>
            <p><em>Template suitable for advanced authors who are producing HTML documents. This template takes advantage of the ability to omit certain tags for some elements. Authors who are not familiar with, or are uncomfortable with, these features should avoid this template.</em></p>
            <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8">
&lt;title>Minimal HTML Template&lt;/title>

        <h3>3 The HTML and XHTML Syntax</h3>
        <p>It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML document—the elements and attributes, and their meanings—and the syntax in which it is written.</p>
        <p>HTML has a defined set of elements and attributes which can be used in a document; each designed for a specific purpose with their own meaning. Consider this set of elements to be analogous to the list of words in a dictionary. This includes elements for headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links, form controls and many other features. This is the vocabulary of HTML. Similarly, just as natural languages have grammatical rules for how different words can be used, HTML has rules for where and how each element and attribute can be used.</p>
        <p>The basic structure of elements in an HTML document is a tree structure. Most elements have at most one parent element, (except for the root element), and may have any number of child elements. This structure needs to be reflected in the syntax used to write the document.</p>
