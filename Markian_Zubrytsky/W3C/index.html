    <section id="intro">
        <h1 class="hdr">1 Introduction</h1>

        <p>This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and
            its associated DOM APIs and is intended for web site and application
            developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their students.
            That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do so.</p>

        <p>This guide is structured into three major sections. The first provides a
            set of basic templates for authors to get started with.</p>

        <p>The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML and
            XHTML documents. This will investigate both the similarities and differences
            between the two alternatives and provides guidance on choosing which to use
            for your own projects, depending on your needs. Additionally, this will also
            provide details about creating polyglot documents — that is, documents that
            conform to both HTML and XHTML simultaneiously — including issues related to
            ensuring stylesheets and scripts work correctly under both conditions.</p>

        <p>The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML vocabulary.
            Each element is described, providing details about its its meaning, allowed
            attributes, content models and DOM APIs. Each is accompanied by clear examples
            illustrating how the element is designed to be used for a range of different
            use cases.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="basics">
        <h1 class="hdr">2 Basic Templates</h1>

        <p>The following basic templates are designed to be used as starting points
            for the documents you create. Several alternatives are provided, allowing
            individuals to choose the template that is most appropriate for their needs.</p>

    <section id="syntax">
        <h1 class="hdr">3 The HTML and XHTML Syntax</h1>

        <p>It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML
            document—the elements and attributes, and their meanings—and the syntax in
            which it is written.</p>

        <p>HTML has a defined set of elements and attributes which can be used in a
            document; each designed for a specific purpose with their own meaning.
            Consider this set of elements to be analogous to the list of words in a
            dictionary. This includes elements for headings, paragraphs, lists, tables,
            links, form controls and many other features. This is the vocabulary of HTML.
            Similarly, just as natural languages have grammatical rules for how different
            words can be used, HTML has rules for where and how each element and
            attribute can be used.</p>

        <p>The basic structure of elements in an HTML document is a tree structure.
            Most elements have at most one parent element, (except for the root element),
            and may have any number of child elements. This structure needs to be
            reflected in the syntax used to write the document.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="syn_over">

        <h2 class="hdr">3.1 Syntactic Overview</h2>

        <p>There are two syntaxes that can be used: the traditional HTML syntax, and
            the XHTML syntax. While these are similar, each is optimised for different
            needs and authoring habits. The former is more lenient in its design and
            handling requirements, and has a number of convenient shorthands for authors
            to use. The latter is based on XML and has much stricter syntactic
            requirements, designed to discourage the proliferation of syntactic errors.</p>

        <p>The HTML syntax is loosely based upon the older, though very widely used
            syntax from HTML 4.01. Although it is inspired by its SGML origins, in
            practice, it really only shares minor syntactic similarities. This features
            a range of shorthand syntaxes, designed to make hand coding more convenient,
            such as allowing the omission of some optional tags and attribute values.
            Authors are free to choose whether or not they wish to take advantage of
            these shorthand features based upon their own personal preferences.</p>

        <p>XHTML, however, is based on the much more strict XML syntax. While this
            too is inspired by SGML, this syntax requires documents to be well-formed,
            which some people prefer because of its stricter error handling, forcing
            authors to maintain cleaner markup.</p>

        <p>Note: The XHTML document does not need to include the DOCTYPE because
            XHTML documents that are delivered correctly using an XML MIME type and
            are processed as XML by browsers, are always rendered in no quirks mode.
            However, the DOCTYPE may optionally be included, and should be included if the
            document uses the compatible subset of markup that is conforming in both HTML
            and XHTML, and is ever expected to be used in text/html environments.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="syn">
        <h2 class="hdr">3.2 The Syntax</h2>

        <p>There are a number of basic components make up the syntax of HTML, that
            are used throughout any document. These include the DOCTYPE declaration,
            elements, attributes, comments, text and CDATA sections.</p>

        <section id="Permitted_DOC">
            <h3>3.2.1 Obsolete But Permitted DOCTYPEs</h3>

            <p>In order to ease the the transitional process from previous editions of
                HTML, selected legacy DOCTYPEs are grandfathered into the HTML syntax as
                conforming, but they are considered obsolete. This does not apply to
                XHTML.</p>

            <p><i>Warning: When using these DOCTYPEs, some validators may apply
                conformance requirements from older specifications, instead of the
                requirements of HTML5. HTML5 conformance checkers are required to issue a
                warning if one is present. Authors are strongly discouraged from using
                these DOCTYPEs.
            </i></p>

            <p>For the permitted DOCTYPEs using only a public identifier, the syntax is
                as follows. The highlighted fragments indicate case insensitivity in the
                HTML syntax
            </p>

            <figure class="pre1">
                <figcaption class="precap"><strong>HTML Example:</strong></figcaption>
                <p><i>The obsolete but permitted HTML 4.01 Strict DOCTYPE with only the
                    public identifier.</i></p>
                <pre>
            <code>
              &lt!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt
            </code>
          </pre>
            </figure>

            <p>For the permitted DOCTYPEs that also have a system identifier, the
                syntax is:
            </p>

            <figure class="pre1">
                <figcaption class="precap"><strong>HTML Example:</strong></figcaption>
                <p><i>The obsolete but permitted HTML 4.01 Strict DOCTYPE with both the
                    public and system identifiers.</i></p>
