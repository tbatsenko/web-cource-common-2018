        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This document explains the syntax, vocabulary and the available APIs for HTML5 documents, focussing on
            simplicity and practical applications for beginners while also providing in depth information for more
            advanced web developers.This document is complimentary to the HTML5 Guide.</p>

        <p>This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. W3C maintains a
            public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also
            includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the
            individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6

        <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and its associated DOM APIs and is
            intended for web site and application developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their
            students. That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do so.</p>

        <h2 id="syntax">3 The HTML and XHTML Syntax</h2>
        <p>It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML document—the elements and attributes,
            and their meanings—and the syntax in which it is written.</p>
        <article>
            <h3 id="syn_ov">3.1 Syntactic Overview</h3>
            <p>There are two syntaxes that can be used: the traditional HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax. While these
                are similar, each is optimised for different needs and authoring habits. The former is more lenient in
                its design and handling requirements, and has a number of convenient shorthands for authors to use. The
                latter is based on XML and has much stricter syntactic requirements, designed to discourage the
                proliferation of syntactic errors.</p>
            <p><font color="green"><i>Note: The XHTML document does not need to include the DOCTYPE because XHTML
                documents that are delivered correctly using an XML MIME type and are processed as XML by browsers, are
                always rendered in no quirks mode. However, the DOCTYPE may optionally be included, and should be
                included if the document uses the compatible subset of markup that is conforming in both HTML and XHTML,
                and is ever expected to be used in <font color="red">text/html</font> environments.</i></font></p>
            <article>
                <i id="doctypes">3.2.1.1 Obsolete But Permitted DOCTYPEs</i>
                <p>In order to ease the the transitional process from previous editions of HTML, selected legacy DOCTYPEs are grandfathered into the HTML syntax as conforming, but they are considered obsolete. This does not apply to XHTML.</p>
