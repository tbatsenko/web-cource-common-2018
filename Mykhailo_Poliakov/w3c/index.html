        <h2 id="introduction"> 1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and
            its associated DOM APIs and is intended for web site and application
            developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their students.
            That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do
            so.
        </p>
        <p>
            This guide is structured into three major sections.  The first provides
            a set of basic templates for authors to get started with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML
            and XHTML documents.  This will investigate both the similarities and
            differences between the two alternatives and provides guidance on
            choosing which to use for your own projects, depending on your needs.
            Additionally, this will also provide details about creating polyglot
            documents — that is, documents that conform to both
            HTML and XHTML simultaneiously — including issues
            related to ensuring stylesheets and scripts work correctly under both
            conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML
            vocabulary.  Each element is described, providing details about its
            its meaning, allowed attributes, content models and DOM APIs.  Each
            is accompanied by clear examples illustrating how the element is
            designed to be used for a range of different use cases.

        <h2 id="templates">2 Basic Templates</h2>
        <p>
            The following basic templates are designed to be used as starting points
            for the documents you create.  Several alternatives are provided,
            allowing individuals to choose the template that is most appropriate for
            their needs.

        <h2 id="syntax">3 The HTML and XHTML Syntax</h2>
        <p>
            It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML
            document—the elements and attributes, and their meanings—and the syntax
            in which it is written.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML has a defined set of elements and attributes which can be used in
            a document; each designed for a specific purpose with their own meaning.
            Consider this set of elements to be analogous to the list of words in a
            dictionary.  This includes elements for headings, paragraphs, lists,
            tables, links, form controls and many other features.  This is the
            vocabulary of HTML. Similarly, just as natural languages have grammatical
            rules for how different words can be used, HTML has rules for where and
            how each element and attribute can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic structure of elements in an HTML document is a tree structure.
            Most elements have at most one parent element, (except for the root
            element), and may have any number of child elements. This structure needs
            to be reflected in the syntax used to write the document.
        </p>
    
        <section>
            <h3 id="syntax-overview">3.1 Syntactic Overview</h3>
            <p>
                There are two syntaxes that can be used: the traditional HTML syntax,
                and the XHTML syntax.  While these are similar, each is optimised for
                different needs and authoring habits.  The former is more lenient in
                its design and handling requirements, and has a number of convenient
                shorthands for authors to use.  The latter is based on XML and has
                much stricter syntactic requirements, designed to discourage the
                proliferation of syntactic errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The HTML syntax is loosely based upon the older, though very widely
                used syntax from HTML 4.01.  Although it is inspired by its SGML
                origins, in practice, it really only shares minor syntactic
                similarities. This features a range of shorthand syntaxes, designed
                to make hand coding more convenient, such as allowing the omission of
                some optional tags and attribute values.  Authors are free to choose
                whether or not they wish to take advantage of these shorthand
                features based upon their own personal preferences.
