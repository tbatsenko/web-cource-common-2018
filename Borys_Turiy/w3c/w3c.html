  <h2 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
  <p>This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and
    its associated DOM APIs and is intended for web site and application
    developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their students.
    That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do
    so.</p>

  <p>This guide is structured into three major sections. The first provides
    a set of basic templates for authors to get started with.</p>

  <p>The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML
    and XHTML documents. This will investigate both the similarities and
    differences between the two alternatives and provides guidance on
    choosing which to use for your own projects, depending on your needs.
    Additionally, this will also provide details about creating polyglot
    documents&#8202;—&#8202;that is, documents that conform to both
    HTML and XHTML simultaneiously&#8202;—&#8202;including issues
    related to ensuring stylesheets and scripts work correctly under both
    conditions.</p>

  <p>The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML
    vocabulary. Each element is described, providing details about its
    its meaning, allowed attributes, content models and DOM APIs. Each
    is accompanied by clear examples illustrating how the element is
    designed to be used for a range of different use cases.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="basic-templates">2 Basic Templates</h2>
  <p>
    The following basic templates are designed to be used as starting points for the documents you create. Several
    alternatives are provided, allowing individuals to choose the template that is most appropriate for their needs.
  </p>
  <h5>Simple: HTML:</h5>
  <code>
    <em>The most basic template recommended for most authors.</em>
    <code>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;HTML Template&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Insert content here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
  </code>
  <h5>Intermediate: HTML and XHTML Polyglot:
  </h5>
  <code>
    <em>Template suitable for intermediate authors who are producing documents adhering to the polyglot markup
      conventions. While this template is safe for beginners to use, it is only recommended for authors familiar
      with the techniques for creating polyglot documents.</em>
    <code>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"/&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Polyglot (X)HTML Template&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Insert content here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
  </code>
  <h5>Advanced: XHTML:
  </h5>
  <code>
    <em>Template suitable for advanced authors who are producing XHTML documents. This template is not suitable for
      use as HTML because it lacks the DOCTYPE and does not declare the character encoding. Authors using this
      template should be using UTF-8 or UTF-16, or should at least be aware of how to declare the correct encoding
      for XML.</em>
    <code>
      &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;XHTML Template&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Insert content here.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;</code>
  </code>
  <h5>Advanced: Minimal HTML:
  </h5>
  <code>
    <em>Template suitable for advanced authors who are producing HTML documents. This template takes advantage of
      the ability to omit certain tags for some elements. Authors who are not familiar with, or are uncomfortable
      with, these features should avoid this template.</em>

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Minimal HTML Template&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Insert content here.&lt;/p&gt;

  <h2 id="the-html-and-xhtml-syntax">3 The HTML and XHTML Syntax</h2>

  <p>It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML
    document—the elements and attributes, and their meanings—and the syntax
    in which it is written.</p>

  <p>HTML has a defined set of elements and attributes which can be used in
    a document; each designed for a specific purpose with their own meaning.
    Consider this set of elements to be analogous to the list of words in a
    dictionary. This includes elements for headings, paragraphs, lists,
    tables, links, form controls and many other features. This is the
    vocabulary of HTML. Similarly, just as natural languages have grammatical
    rules for how different words can be used, HTML has rules for where and
    how each element and attribute can be used.</p>

  <p>The basic structure of elements in an HTML document is a tree structure.
    Most elements have at most one parent element, (except for the root
    element), and may have any number of child elements. This structure needs
    to be reflected in the syntax used to write the document.</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="syntactic-overview">3.1 Syntactic Overview</h3>

    <p>There are two syntaxes that can be used: the traditional HTML syntax,
      and the XHTML syntax. While these are similar, each is optimised for
      different needs and authoring habits. The former is more lenient in
      its design and handling requirements, and has a number of convenient
      shorthands for authors to use. The latter is based on XML and has
      much stricter syntactic requirements, designed to discourage the
      proliferation of syntactic errors.</p>

    <p>The HTML syntax is loosely based upon the older, though very widely
      used syntax from HTML 4.01. Although it is inspired by its SGML
      origins, in practice, it really only shares minor syntactic
      similarities. This features a range of shorthand syntaxes, designed
      to make hand coding more convenient, such as allowing the omission of
      some optional tags and attribute values. Authors are free to choose
      whether or not they wish to take advantage of these shorthand
      features based upon their own personal codeferences.</p>
    <h5>HTML Example:
    </h5>
    <code>
      <em>A basic HTML document,
        demonstrating some shorthand syntax.</em>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;An HTML Document&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body class=example&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is an example HTML document.
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>


    <p>XHTML, however, is based on the much more strict XML syntax. While
      this too is inspired by SGML, this syntax requires documents to be
      well-formed, which some people codefer because of its stricter error
      handling, forcing authors to maintain cleaner markup.</p>


    <h5>XHTML Example:
    </h5>
    <code>
      <em>A basic XHTML document,
        demonstrating the stricter XML syntax.</em>
      <code>
        &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;An HTML Document&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body class="example"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is an example HTML document.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
      </code>
    </code>


    <p style="color:green">Note: The XHTML document does not need to include the
      DOCTYPE because XHTML documents that are delivered correctly using an
      XML MIME type and are processed as XML by browsers, are always rendered
      in <em>no quirks mode</em>. However, the DOCTYPE may optionally be
      included, and should be included if the document uses the compatible
      subset of markup that is conforming in both HTML and XHTML, and is ever
      expected to be used in <code>text/html</code> environments.</p>

    <p>Due to the similarities of both the HTML and XHTML syntaxes, it is
      possible to mark up documents using a common subset of the syntax
      that is the same in both, while avoiding the syntactic features that
      are unique to each. This type of document is said to use polyglot
      markup, often simply referred to as a polyglot document, because it
      simultaneously conforms to both syntaxes and may be treated as either.
      There are a number of issues involved with creating such documents
      and authors wishing to do so should familiarise themselves with the
      similarities and differences between HTML and XHTML.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="the-syntax"><span class="secno">3.2 </span>The Syntax</h3>
    <p>There are a number of basic components make up the syntax of HTML,
      that are used throughout any document. These include the
      DOCTYPE declaration, elements, attributes, comments,
      text and CDATA sections.</p>

    <section>
      <h4 id="doctype-declaration"><span class="secno">3.2.1 </span>DOCTYPE Declaration</h4>

      <p>The Document Type Declaration needs to be codesent at the beginning of a
        document that uses the HTML syntax. It may optionally be used within the
        XHTML syntax, but it is not required. The following DOCTYPE
        is strongly recommended for most HTML documents:</p>

      <h5>Example:
      </h5>
      <code>
        <em>The HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration.</em>
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        </code>
      </code>

      <p>For compatibility with legacy producers of HTML — that is, software that
        outputs HTML documents — an alternative legacy compatibility DOCTYPE is available.
        This is recommended for use by systems that are unable to output the DOCTYPE
        given above. This limitation occurs in software that expects a
        DOCTYPE to include either a <code>PUBLIC</code> or
        <code>SYSTEM</code> identifier, and is unable to omit them.
        The canonical form of this DOCTYPE is as follows:</p>

      <h5>Example:
      </h5>
      <code>
        <em>The HTML5 legacy compatibility DOCTYPE declaration.</em>
        <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"&gt;
        </code>
      </code>

      <p style="color:green">Note: The term "legacy-compat" refers to compatibility with legacy
        producers only. In particular, it does not refer to compatibility with
        legacy browsers, which, in practice, ignore SYSTEM identifiers and DTDs.</p>

      <p>In HTML, the DOCTYPE is case insensitive, except for the quoted string
        <code>"about:legacy-compat"</code>, which must be written in lower case. This quoted
        string, however, may also be quoted with single quotes, rather than double quotes.
        The highlighted fragments below illustrate which parts are case insensitive in HTML.</p>

      <h5>Example:
      </h5>
      <code>
        <em>The three conforming variants of the HTML5 DOCTYPE declarations, indicating case insensitivity in
          the HTML syntax..</em>
        <code>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

          &lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"&gt;

          &lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM 'about:legacy-compat'&gt;
        </code>
      </code>


      <p>For XHTML, the DOCTYPE may be omitted because it is unnecessary.
        If you choose to use a DOCTYPE, then the canonical case-sensitive
        versions of the above DOCTYPEs are recommended. But there are no
        restrictions placed on the use of alternative DOCTYPEs. You may,
        if you wish, use a custom DOCTYPE referring to a custom DTD,
        typically for validation purposes. Although, be advised that DTDs
        have a number of limitations compared with other alternative
        schema languages and validation techniques.</p>

      <h5 id="obsolete-but-permitted-doctypes">3.2.1.1 Obsolete But Permitted DOCTYPEs</h5>

      <p>In order to ease the the transitional process from codevious
        editions of HTML, selected legacy DOCTYPEs are grandfathered into
        the HTML syntax as conforming, but they are considered obsolete.
        This does not apply to XHTML.</p>

      <p style="color:red">Warning: When using these DOCTYPEs, some validators
        may apply conformance requirements from older specifications,
        instead of the requirements of HTML5. HTML5 conformance
        checkers are required to issue a warning if one is codesent.
        Authors are <em>strongly discouraged</em> from using these
        DOCTYPEs.</p>

      <p>For the permitted DOCTYPEs using only a <i>public identifier</i>, the
        syntax is as follows. The highlighted fragments indicate case
        insensitivity in the HTML syntax.</p>
      <h5>HTML Example:
      </h5>
      <code>
        <em>The obsolete but permitted HTML 4.01 Strict DOCTYPE with only the public identifier.</em>
        <code>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;

        </code>
      </code>

      <p>For the permitted DOCTYPEs that also have a <i>system identifier</i>, the syntax is:</p>
      <h5>HTML Example:

      <p style="color:red;border: 1px solid red;">This section needs revising and may be moved to an
        external document and simply referred to.</p>

      <p>The DOCTYPE originates from HTML’s SGML lineage and,
        in codevious levels of HTML, was originally used to refer to a
        Document Type Definition (DTD) — a formal declaration of the
        elements, attributes and syntactic features that could be used
        within the document. Those who are familiar with codevious levels
        of HTML will notice that there is no <code>PUBLIC</code>
        identifier codesent in this DOCTYPE, which were used
        to refer to the DTD. Also, note that the <code>about:</code> URI
        scheme in the <code>SYSTEM</code> identifier of the latter
        DOCTYPE is used specifically because it cannot be
        resolved to any specific DTD.</p>

      <p>As HTML5 is no longer formally based upon SGML, the
        DOCTYPE no longer serves this purpose, and thus no
        longer needs to refer to a DTD. However, due to legacy
        constraints, it has gained another very important purpose:
        triggering no-quirks mode in browsers.</p>

      <p>HTML5 defines three modes: <strong>quirks mode</strong>,
        <strong>limited quirks mode</strong> and <strong>no quirks mode</strong>,
        of which only the latter is considered conforming to use. The reason for
        this is due to backwards compatibility. The important thing to understand
        is that there are some differences in the way documents are visually
        rendered in each of the modes; and to ensure the most standards compliant
        rendering, it is important to ensure no-quirks mode is used.</p>
