        <p class="first-paragraph">This document explains the syntax, vocabulary and the available APIs for HTML5 documents, focussing on
            simplicity and practical applications for beginners while also providing in depth information for more
            advanced web developers.This document is complimentary to the HTML5 Guide.</p>

            <h1>1 Introduction</h1>
            <p>This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary and its associated DOM APIs and is
                intended for web site and application developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and their
                students. That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who teach others to do so.</p>
            <p>This guide is structured into three major sections. The first provides a set of basic t

                emplates for
                authors to get started with.</p>
            <p>The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML and XHTML documents. This will
                investigate both the similarities and differences between the two alternatives and provides guidance on
                choosing which to use for your own projects, depending on your needs. Additionally, this will also
                provide details about creating polyglot documents — that is, documents that conform to both HTML and
                XHTML simultaneiously — including issues related to ensuring stylesheets and scripts work correctly
                under both conditions.</p>
            <p>The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML vocabulary. Each element is described,
                providing details about its its meaning, allowed attributes, content models and DOM APIs. Each is
                accompanied by clear examples illustrating how the element is designed to be used for a range of
                different use cases.</p></article>

            <h1>3 The HTML and XHTML Syntax</h1>
            <p>It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML document—the elements and
                attributes, and their meanings—and the syntax in which it is written.</p>
            <p>HTML has a defined set of elements and attributes which can be used in a document; each designed for a
                specific purpose with their own meaning. Consider this set of elements to be analogous to the list of
                words in a dictionary. This includes elements for headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, links, form
                controls and many other features. This is the vocabulary of HTML. Similarly, just as natural
                languages have grammatical rules for how different words can be used, HTML has rules for where and
                how each element and attribute can be used.</p>
            <p>
                The basic structure of elements in an HTML document is a tree structure. Most elements have at most one
                parent element, (except for the root element), and may have any number of child elements. This
                structure needs to be reflected in the syntax used to write the document.
            </p>
            <h3>3.1 Syntactic Overview</h3>
            <p>There are two syntaxes that can be used: the traditional HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax.
                While these are similar, each is optimised for different needs and authoring habits. The former
                is more lenient in its design and handling requirements, and has a number of convenient shorthands
                for authors to use. The latter is based on XML and has much stricter syntactic requirements, designed
                to discourage the proliferation of syntactic errors.

                the proliferation of syntactic errors.
            </p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>XHTML, however, is based on the much more strict XML syntax. While this too is inspired by SGML, this
                syntax requires documents to be well-formed, which some people prefer because of its stricter error
                handling, forcing authors to maintain cleaner markup.</p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>Note: The XHTML document does not need to include the DOCTYPE because XHTML documents that are delivered
                correctly using an XML MIME type and are processed as XML by browsers, are always rendered in no quirks
                mode. However, the DOCTYPE may optionally be included, and should be included if the document uses the
                compatible subset of markup that is conforming in both HTML and XHTML, and is ever expected to be used
                in text/html environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to the similarities of both the HTML and XHTML syntaxes, it is possible to mark up documents using
                a common subset of the syntax that is the same in both, while avoiding the syntactic features that are
                unique to each. This type of document is said to use polyglot markup, often simply referred to as a
                polyglot document, because it simultaneously conforms to both syntaxes and may be treated as either.
                There are a number of issues involved with creating such documents and authors wishing to do so should
                familiarise themselves with the similarities and differences between HTML and XHTML.
            </p>
            <h3>3.2 The Syntax</h3>
            <p>There are a number of basic components make up the syntax of HTML, that are used throughout any document.
                These include the DOCTYPE declaration, elements, attributes, comments, text and CDATA sections.</p>
            <h4>3.2.1 DOCTYPE Declaration</h4>
            <p>The Document Type Declaration needs to be present at the beginning of a document that uses the HTML
                syntax. It may optionally be used within the XHTML syntax, but it is not required. The following
                DOCTYPE is strongly recommended for most HTML documents:</p>
            <figure>
            </figure>
            <p>For compatibility with legacy producers of HTML — that is, software that outputs HTML documents — an
                alternative legacy compatibility DOCTYPE is available. This is recommended for use by systems that are
                unable to output the DOCTYPE given above. This limitation occurs in software that expects a DOCTYPE to
                include either a PUBLIC or SYSTEM identifier, and is unable to omit them. The canonical form of this
                DOCTYPE is as follows:</p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>Note: The term "legacy-compat" refers to compatibility with legacy producers only. In particular, it
                does not refer to compatibility with legacy browsers, which, in practice, ignore SYSTEM identifiers
                and DTDs.</p>
            <p>In HTML, the DOCTYPE is case insensitive, except for the quoted string "about:legacy-compat", which must
                be written in lower case. This quoted string, however, may also be quoted with single quotes, rather
                than double quotes. The highlighted fragments below illustrate which parts
                are case insensitive in HTML.</p>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>For XHTML, the DOCTYPE may be omitted because it is unnecessary. If you choose to use a DOCTYPE,
                then the canonical case-sensitive versions of the above DOCTYPEs are recommended. But there are
                no restrictions placed on the use of alternative DOCTYPEs. You may, if you wish, use a custom DOCTYPE
                referring to a custom DTD, typically for validation purposes. Although, be advised that DTDs have a
                number of limitations compared with other alternative schema languages and validation techniques.
            </p>
            <h4>3.2.1.1 Obsolete But Permitted DOCTYPEs</h4>
            <p>In order to ease the the transitional process from previous editions of HTML, selected legacy DOCTYPEs
                are grandfathered into the HTML syntax as conforming, but they are considered obsolete. This does not
                apply to XHTML.</p>
            <p>Warning: When using these DOCTYPEs, some validators may apply conformance requirements from older
                specifications, instead of the requirements of HTML5. HTML5 conformance checkers are required to issue
                a warning if one is present. Authors are strongly discouraged from using these DOCTYPEs.

            </p>
            <p>For the permitted DOCTYPEs using only a public identifier, the syntax is as follows. The highlighted
                fragments indicate case insensitivity in the HTML syntax.</p>
            <figure></figure>

            <p>n addition to those, the following public and system identifiers in the table below may be
                substituted accordingly.</p>
